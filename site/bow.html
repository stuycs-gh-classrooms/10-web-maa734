    <h1>The Bow</h1>
    <div class="box">
      <p class="box-text">
        The bow is what a person uses to actually play the violin. When playing, the bow is placed between the fingerboard and the tailpiece to create sound. The bow consists of many parts but two of the main parts are the horsehair and the frog.

      <h2>The Horse Hair</h2>

      <p class="box-text">
        The bow has horse hair which is rosened to make sound on the violin. This gives it a smoothness and grip which allows for a nice sound. There are about 160-180 individual hairs which are all tightly bound together from the bottom of the bow to the tip. The horse hair is usually white and the bow itself is made of wood or carbon fiber. Other string instruments also use this horse hair like the cello and viola.<br>

      <h2>The Frog</h2>

      <p class="box-text">
        The frog is where a person holds the bow in a particular bow hold to play it. The frog of the bow has a metal sliding part at the bottom which can be rotated to adjust the tightness of the horse hair. When played, the bow is tightened, and when it is put away it is usually loosened slightly.<br>
