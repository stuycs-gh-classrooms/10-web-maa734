    <p>
      The scroll is at the top of the violin and is curved holding all the strings. It keeps the strings tight and can have patterns on it sometimes. <br>

    <h2>The Fingerboard</h2>
    <p>
      The fingerboard is where the strings are placed on. It is the black piece that goes up to the scroll and where you place your fingers for different notes which make different sounds. <br>

    <h2>The Pegs</h2>
    <p>
      The pegs are on the scroll and are used to tune the violin. There are additional fine tuners on the tailpiece of thev violin which is connected to the shoulder rest. The fine tuners as the name suggests tune the violin more carefully whereas the pegs are more for general tuning and pitch.<br>
