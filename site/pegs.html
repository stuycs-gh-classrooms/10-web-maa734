    <h2>The Pegs</h2>
    <p>
      The pegs are on the scroll and are used to tune the violin. There are additional fine tuners on the tailpiece of thev violin which is connected to the shoulder rest. The fine tuners as the name suggests tune the violin more carefully whereas the pegs are more for general tuning and pitch.<br>
