    <h1>The Koch Curve</h1>
      <p>
        Basic curve koch_curve(t, 4, 20)
      </p>
      <img src="koch.png" width = "50%">
      <p>
        This koch curve's modifications are:
        At the end the turtle is turned to the right by 60 degrees causing the pattern to go over itself.
        Additionally the colors are randomized in a specific range by changing the amount of red in the color.
        Also the lengths of the koch curve are modified to give the specific shape of the pattern.
      </p>

      <h1>The Sierpinski Triangle</h1>
        <p>
          Basic triangle sierpinski(t, 5, 200)
        </p>
        <img src="sierpinski.png" width = "50%">
        <p>
          The sierpinski's modifications are:
          All of the angles in the recursion are swapped, making left right and right left.
          The colors are also once again randomized in a specific range changing the amount of blue in the color.
          Lastly, the turtle puts the pen up before completing the triangles, leaving empty spaces in the sierpinski triangle.

      <h1>The Tree</h1>
        <p>
          Basic tree(t, 4, 50, 20)
        </p>
        <img src="tree.png" width = "50%">
        <p>
          The tree's modifications are:
          The lengths of going forward and backwards in the intial and final steps are changed making them less.
          The tree is also brown.
          In each recursion the there is a randomized amount added to the angle.
        </p>
